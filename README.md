# Video Game Library
This is a videogame library like the one at Steam.
It will help you keep your game information up to date.

This version is the base game version without optimizations like react query. Do this to test your skills with react basics.

## For future upgrades:
- Make the site customizable (users log in and stuff)
- Each user can make "playlists" of their favorite games
